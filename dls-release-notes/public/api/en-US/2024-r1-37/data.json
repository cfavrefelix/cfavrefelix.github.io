This has raised concerns about potential loss of customer-made changes. In our commitment to a more user-friendly experience and a seamless upgrade process, we have developed a solution that preserves customer modifications while facilitating smooth upgrades. This involved updating the standard mapping, categorizing each field as either editable or non-editable.</p><p>Starting now, the mapping object grid has evolved:</p><ul><li>Removing the description, required, data type, and read-only fields on the Intacct side from the default display. Despite this change, these fields remain accessible through column settings.</li><li>Introducing the \"Editable\" column which indicates which fields have shifted from editable to non-editable.</li><li>Renaming the property option to default property, which displays the standard value if the field is updated by the customer</li></ul><p>It's important to note that with recent changes, the standard mapping has transitioned from allowing modification of any field to only permitting edits to fields identified as editable in this release.</p>",
